Semantics:

Only pawns can promote

Knight invalid move: Ncc6 
	A knight in the c file cannot move to the same file.
	A knight can only move two files/rank apart
	
Pawns can only capture the adjacent files
	exd5 valid, exh8 invalid.

Design:

doGetMoves always allocates a new Set<MoveVector>. Is it mandatory to have a template method?
Couldn't the subclass simply populate and unmodifiable set?


To Implement:

King moves
Queen moves
En passant capture 
File and Rank desambiguation
The strategies for each piece are passed via a static init (ugh!)
